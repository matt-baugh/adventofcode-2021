Cheat-sheet:
- Trying to find iteration where multiple conditions are met? Find first iteration of each condition and then compute lowest common multiple of those iterations.
- Counting something which is difficult to detect? Look for something else to count instead that has a equivelence with the target thing (e.g. counting edges vs counting vertices).
